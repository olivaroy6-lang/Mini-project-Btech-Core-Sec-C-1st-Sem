/*Problem 1: Reverse the Array (Neha’s Diary Entries)
🧩 Problem Story:

Neha keeps a diary of her daily exercise times (in minutes).
She wants to review her progress, but she prefers to see the latest day’s record first.

Write a program to help Neha reverse the order of her recorded exercise times.

✅ Task:

Given n numbers representing Neha’s daily exercise time, print them in reverse order.

🧠 Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n — the number of days.

The second line contains n space-separated integers representing exercise times.
Output Format:

Print the exercise times in reverse order on a single line separated by spaces.

🧩 Example 1:

Input
5
10 20 30 40 50

Output
50 40 30 20 10*/


#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n, i;
    printf("Enter number of days: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int a[n];
    printf("Enter exercise times: ");
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    printf("Reversed: ");
    for(i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        printf("%d ", a[i]);
    return 0;
