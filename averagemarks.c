/*Question: The Student’s Marks Analyzer

💡 Problem Story:
A teacher wants to analyze the marks of her students in a test.
She asks you to write a program that stores the marks of n students and finds out:

The total marks obtained by all students.

The average marks of the class.

Can you help the teacher by writing the program?
Task:

Write a program that takes the number of students and their marks as input and calculates:

The total marks

The average marks

Input Format:

The first line contains one integer n — number of students.

The next line contains n integers — marks of each student.

📤 Output Format:

Print two lines:

First line: "Total Marks = <value>"

Second line: "Average Marks = <value>"
Example 1:

Input:
5
80 70 90 85 75

Output:
Total Marks = 400
Average Marks = 80.00*/


#include <stdio.h>
int main() 
{
    int n, i, total = 0;
    float avg;
    printf("Enter number of students: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int marks[n];
    printf("Enter marks: ");
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &marks[i]);
        total += marks[i];
    }
    avg = (float)total / n;
    printf("Total Marks = %d\n", total);
    printf("Average Marks = %.2f\n", avg);
    return 0;
}
